ColorFill  CHANGES



1.3.2 (2022-02-22)
- updated FlatLaf - Flat Look and Feel to version 2.0.1
  * https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf/releases
- improved AStarPuchertStrategy and AStarFlolleStrategy
  * they use less memory and run slightly faster
- performed another complete benchmark run of codegolf26232
  * same optimal result of 1,985,078 steps
  * first run in early 2018 (using version 1.1.1) took about 120 hours
  * latest run took 75 minutes - this huge speedup was made possible by:
  * the numerous code optimizations (about 5 times as fast as version 1.1.1)
  * and the much more powerful computer (8-cores CPU with 64 GB of RAM)



1.3.1 (2020-12-19)
- added GUI Look&Feel configuration to settings dialog
- added FlatLaf - Flat Look and Feel (with 2 light and 2 dark themes)

- added color scheme: Grayscale
- added highlight color: Blue
- small speedup of AStarPuchertStrategy and AStarFlolleStrategy



1.3.0 (2020-08-29)
- Java 8 or higher is required
- added checkboxes to switch on/off each solver strategy (persistent setting)
  * DfsExhaustiveStrategy is disabled by default (it's so slow)
- optimized AStarPuchertStrategy (about twice as fast as version 1.2.2)
  * optimal solutions are found in less time and using less memory
- added AStarFlolleStrategy
  * idea is taken from the program "terminal-flood" by Flolle (Florian Fischer)
  * https://github.com/Flolle/terminal-flood
  * based on terminal-flood InadmissibleSlowStrategy, with minor modifications
  * doesn't always find optimal solutions, but usually finds very good solutions
  * runs faster and uses less memory than AStarPuchertStrategy
- added "-benchmark" feature
  * command line parameters: -benchmark <input file> [solver strategy]
  * in folder "benchmark" there are a shell script, some test data and results
  * several of the test datasets have been copied from Flolle's terminal-flood
- improved import/export of Board data from/to text data
  * supports arbitrary characters for colors (not limited to numbers anymore)
  * maximum number of distinct characters (colors) per board is 16



1.2.2 (2020-01-27)
- optimized AStarPuchertStrategy (more than twice as fast as version 1.1.1)



1.2.1 (2019-02-17)
- game board retains its aspect ratio when the window is resized



1.2 (2019-01-30)
- added GUI checkbox and persistent prefs for computed solutions
- game board remains a square when the window is resized
- optimized AStarPuchertStrategy (faster and uses less memory)



1.1.2 (2018-10-02)

- added special highlighting of cells if this color will be completed in one move
- improved graphics performance by using antialiasing for the circles only



1.1.1 (2018-04-15)

- small speedup of AStarPuchertStrategy
- program has solved the challenge:  Code Golf: Create a Flood Paint AI
  * https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/26232/create-a-flood-paint-ai
  * using AStarPuchertStrategy to find optimal solutions
  * result is 1,985,078 steps
- fixed initialization of graphical user interface, now compatible with Java 10



1.1 (2018-02-02)

- optimized DfsExhaustiveStrategy
  * much faster then before
  * solves Programming Challenge 19 in about 1/3 of the previous time (now 47 minutes)
- added AStarPuchertStrategy
  * better heuristic for AStar (A*) solver
  * idea taken from the program "floodit" by Aaron and Simon Puchert https://github.com/aaronpuchert/floodit
  * finds optimal solutions (shortest possible)
  * much faster than DfsExhaustiveStrategy
  * solves Programming Challenge 19 in less than 2 (!) minutes



1.0 (2017-02-05)

- program solves the challenge:  Code Golf: Create a Flood Paint AI
  * https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/26232/create-a-flood-paint-ai
  * input data and solver results in directory 'codegolf26232'
  * output of this program, ColorFill: 2,095,015 steps (would have been 1st place!)
- added AStar (A*) solver
  * heuristic taken from the Programming Challenge 19 program by tigrou
- speed up the solver algorithms, especially DfsExhaustiveStrategy
- added DfsExhaustiveStrategy to interactive GUI solvers
  * used for boards up to 15 x 15
  * very slow but it's solutions are always optimal (shortest possible)
- added 'Game ID' feature to GUI
  * copy a game as text to system clipboard to save it
  * paste a game as text from system clipboard to restore it
  * can import GameID from Simon Tatham's "Flood"

0.1.5 (2015-02-04)

- added more color schemes
- added "number of colors" option, values 2...6 are available
