results_ColorFill_exhaustive_details.txt

These two files contain the output of this program, ColorFill.

Its AStarPuchertStrategy scores 20086, which is the same score as the
winning program by Aliaksei Sanko.

20086 has to be the optimal (lowest possible) result, because it was found by
an exhaustive search. That run took just a few seconds. (see details file)
