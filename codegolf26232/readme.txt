the answer/winning program by tigrou on 2014-05-10)

Your task is to create a program that will take a 19-by-19 grid of colours from
1 to 6 as input, in whatever form you choose [...] and return a sequence of
colours that the center square will change to each turn, again in the format
of your choosing [...]
At the end of each sequence of moves, the squares in the 19-by-19 grid must all
be the same colour.

Your program must be entirely deterministic; pseudorandom solutions are
allowed, but the program must generate the same output for the same test case
every time.

The winning program will take the fewest total number of steps to solve all
100,000 test cases found in this file (zipped text file, 14.23 MB).
If two solutions take the same number of steps (e.g. if they both found the
optimal strategy), the shorter program will win.

output of this program, ColorFill: attempt to solve it using exhaustive search!

steps.txt  = A* (tigrou) + 2 fast DFS strategies + exhaustive DFS
steps_.txt = detailed output (shows failed attempts / OutOfMemoryError)

this is work in progress, but very likely it will never be finished because the
exhaustive search needs too much time. also, it fails with OutOfMemoryError and
doesn't give the optimal solution for about 1/5 of the test cases on my machine
that has 16GB of RAM. (using "java -Xmx14800M")

extrapolating the current, partial result, we can expect that the total number
of steps found by exhaustive search would be less than 2,000,000.

output of this program, ColorFill: attempt to solve it using AStar search!

steps.txt  = A* (Puchert heuristic) optimal solutions
steps_.txt = detailed output (on average about 4.3 seconds per solution)

The new AStarPuchertStrategy finds optimal solutions and is very fast. Thanks
to Aaron and Simon Puchert for their solver program which served as a template!

So, after many hours of coding and testing and many more hours of waiting
for the programm to finish, we find that the optimal (shortest possible) result
is 1,985,078 steps!

output of this program, ColorFill: optimized AStar search on faster computer

_steps.txt  = A* (Puchert heuristic) optimal solutions
_steps_.txt = detailed output, including timing information

Since the first complete run of the AStar solver in early 2018 (see above),
I've worked to optimize the code for lower memory usage and higher speed.
Also, I've got a new, more powerful computer with 8 CPU cores and 64 GB of RAM.

The latest run completed in less than 78 minutes, while the first run in 2018
took 7242 minutes. This is a speedup factor greater than 92.

The new computer contributed to this speedup in two ways:
- faster CPU: single-threaded, about 2 to 2.5 times as fast as the old CPU
- more CPU cores and more memory: 8 solver instances worked in parallel

Thus, the speedup factor contributed by improvements of algorithm and code
is:  92 / 2.5 / 8 = 4.6

So, the current version of Colorfill is much faster and would have worked on
the old computer for estimated 26 hours, instead of the 120 hours (5 days!)
it took the old version in 2018.

_steps.txt  = A* (Puchert heuristic) optimal solutions
_steps_.txt = detailed output, including timing information

Repeated the complete run of the improved AStar solver.
Running with 10 parallel processes, it used nearly 60 GB RAM and took about
75 minutes. This small speedup, compared to the 78 minutes of the 8-parallel
run, is due to the hardware multithreading of this 8-cores/16-threads CPU.
